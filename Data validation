In todayâ€™s analysis, we reviewed two passed and two failed metrics, comparing data points between Grafana and our NDL table. For AMF, the number of missing data points is consistent for both passed and failed metrics. However, for SMF and UPF, there is a significant discrepancy between the data points in our table and Grafana. We also reviewed data for SMF, AMF, and UPF for the recent three days (October 11th, 12th, and 13th), and found no major variation compared to October 8th. However, on October 13th, the number of failed AMF metrics was reduced by half compared to October 8th. Please review the G-sheet below and proceed with further analysis.
